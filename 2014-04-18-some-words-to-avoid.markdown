_I wrote down these a few words when I started realizing that there's something wrong with the way I communicate with people. At that time I only noticed some words which rarely led to meaningful results._ 

_Over the years it became clearer to me that I used to rely much more on emotions rather than logic in my communication. I might write my idea about effective communication under different contexts in another post, but here is where I started._ 

**"反正"**
WHATEVER - 这意味着说话的人不思考了。

**"凭什么"**
在谈话中，反问的意义有限，带有攻击意味的反问就更不是在讨论问题了。

**"something/stuff like that"**
意味着说话的人没有想清楚说的是什么。
