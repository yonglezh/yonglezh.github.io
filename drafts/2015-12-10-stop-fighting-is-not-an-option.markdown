_When I first posted this, I didn't really write much other than this title. I think I was just trying to cheer myself up during a hard time. But now I think I still agree with it and I'll try to provide some explanation._

## What are we fighting against? 

A lot of things in our lives - illness, poorness, frustration, anxiety, disappointment, unsatisfied greed, or sometimes simply bad lucks. We all go through ups and downs in our lives. Life is not easy.

> "If you feel life is easy, someone else is taking on your burden." 

## What does it mean to fight against these things? 

It means to survive them, to try our best to function normally despite their influence. 

## Why? What does it mean to keep functioning?

There were so many times when I wanted to give up. There were so many times when I felt there's no point. 

There is a point. I choose to believe that we do have a purpose born into this world. That is to fully utilize our talents to to pursue truth and love. Here love doesn't refer to romantic love, but the love with which we can control our desires and care for others. 

## How? 

It's not easy to know what are the correct actions to take to pursue truth and love in various situations. 
However, that doesn't mean that I can use that as an excuse to do whatever satisfies my own interests. 

At every decision I make, try to reason whether it benefits the world and people around myself, make the choice using my best judgment, and pay the effort to carry it out. 

This is a really high goal to shoot for. I will fall short from time to time, but just keep trying. 

At the end of day, there's no universal meaning of life. This is something that freed me from bouncing between different pursuits and endlessly reasoning about the purpose of life. It helps me focus on doing things, and helps me to carry on with my life despite the circumstances.
